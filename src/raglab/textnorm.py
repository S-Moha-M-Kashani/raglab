"""Persian text normalisation and tokenisation.

The lab's BM25 half, its lexical reranker and its time filter are all built on
this tokeniser — the same one Lodestar's retrieval uses, because a lab measuring
with a different tokeniser from the one production ships is measuring a different
system.

The text is colloquial Farsi typed by a human: Arabic ي/ك mixed with Persian
ی/ک, half-spaces present or missing («می خوام» vs «می‌خوام»), Persian and ASCII
digits, stray diacritics. Two texts that a reader would call identical must
tokenise identically or BM25 and every lexical score silently under-counts.

Nothing here is Farsi-only: Latin words ("apply", "CV") survive untouched, which
matters because the user code-switches constantly.

"""Alternatives considered — "why did you write your own tokeniser?"

**Short answer.** Because no framework owns this job, and the one library that
does would have invalidated 31 measured experiments. Normalisation here serves
only the *lexical* retrieval path — BM25, the reranker's IDF term coverage, the
time filter's phrase matching. The dense path never calls it: a
sentence-transformers model tokenises internally with its own subword
vocabulary.

**Why the obvious option fails.** The naive tokeniser is `text.split()`, and it
is wrong for Persian in a way that is silent. «می‌خوام» (zero-width non-joiner)
and «می خوام» (space) are the same word typed two ways; split on whitespace and
they become different BM25 terms, so a query matches half the documents it
should and no error is raised. The same holds for Arabic ي/ك against Persian
ی/ک, and for Persian ۱۲۳ against ASCII 123.

**Why not Unicode normalisation alone.** `unicodedata.normalize('NFKC', ...)`
is used here, but it is not sufficient and it is worth knowing why in an
interview: U+064A ARABIC YEH and U+06CC FARSI YEH are *distinct letters*, not
compatibility variants, so NFKC leaves them apart. Folding them is a
search-time decision — deliberately lossy, correct for retrieval, wrong for
display. `_LETTER_FOLD` is that decision written down.

**Why not LangChain.** It has no normaliser or tokeniser at all. The proof is
in its own `BM25Retriever`, which exposes a `preprocess_func` parameter with a
non-language-aware default: the framework's position is that tokenising is the
caller's job. Chunking (`RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`), fusion
(`EnsembleRetriever`) and query expansion (`MultiQueryRetriever`) *are* taken
from LangChain in this codebase. This is not one of those seams.

**The libraries that would do it.**

- `hazm` — the standard Persian NLP toolkit: `Normalizer`, `word_tokenize`,
  `Lemmatizer`, POS tagging, and a curated stopword list. The right answer for
  a greenfield project. Pulls `nltk` and a model directory.
- `parsivar` — comparable scope, less actively maintained.
- `spaCy`'s `fa` language class — a tokeniser and stopwords, but no trained
  Persian pipeline, so it buys little over this module.
- Hugging Face `tokenizers` — subword, which is the wrong *unit* for BM25:
  IDF over word-pieces changes what "a term" means and makes rare-literal
  recall worse, which is the one thing BM25 is here for.

**Why they were not adopted.** Two reasons, and the first is decisive.

1. Every BM25 score, IDF weight and lexical rerank in the lab's 31 runs was
   produced by this tokeniser. Replacing it changes those numbers, so old rows
   stop being comparable to new ones — the failure this project guards hardest
   against. A tokeniser swap is an experiment to *measure*, not a refactor.
2. `tokens()` emits a half-spaced compound both joined and split, on purpose,
   because the corpus contains both spellings. A conventional normaliser picks
   one and the other stops matching. That is a recall choice specific to this
   text, not a bug to standardise away.

**What would change the decision.** A lab run with the tokeniser as the only
varied knob, scored on recall and quote recall over
`fixtures/diary_year_fa.json`. If `hazm`'s lemmatiser beats character 4-grams
on morphological overlap, adopt it — and re-run the baseline so the leaderboard
stays internally comparable rather than mixing two tokenisers.
