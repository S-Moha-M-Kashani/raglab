"""Sweep candidate architectures and rank them on the four deciding metrics.

    uv run --extra local-embeddings raglab-sweep            # the candidate sweep
    uv run --extra local-embeddings raglab-sweep --final A  # one candidate, all 112

The extra is what puts sentence-transformers in reach. RAGAS and its pins are
ordinary locked dependencies and need nothing asked for.

Why this exists rather than clicking the panel: the panel runs one job at a time
and a judged sweep is a couple of hours of model calls. This drives the same
`evaluate.run_eval`, writes the same run files into `.runs/`, and therefore lands
in the same leaderboard — it is the panel's runner without the panel.

**Every candidate changes exactly one thing against the baseline.** A sweep whose
rows differ in three knobs each cannot attribute a win to any of them, which is
the failure that makes most tuning folklore rather than measurement.

To run it on models on this machine instead of a paid API — which is the only way
the expensive candidates get measured at all, since F's relevance gate is *k* LLM
calls per question:

    RAGLAB_LLM=ollama uv run raglab-sweep --workers 2

`RAGLAB_LLM` is enough: the answerer/judge pins default per provider (`PAIRINGS`),
because a slug only means something to the backend that serves it. Override either
one with `RAGLAB_SWEEP_ANSWER_MODEL` / `RAGLAB_SWEEP_JUDGE_MODEL`.

Screen the judge first (`uv run raglab-judgescreen`). A judge that answers the
same way to every claim scores every candidate identically, and the sweep cannot
tell you that — its rows would simply look tied.
