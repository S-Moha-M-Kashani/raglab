"""Deterministic scoring against the ground truth.

These metrics run offline, need no LLM, and are the ones to trust when comparing
configurations — an LLM judge introduces variance exactly where you are trying to
measure a 3-point difference. RAGAS metrics (ragas_eval.py) sit on top for the
answer-quality dimensions that genuinely need a model.

Two of them are specific to this ground truth and worth more than the textbook
set:

* **quote recall** — the fraction of the ground truth's *verbatim* evidence
  quotes that appear inside the retrieved text. Session-level recall says the
  right session was found; quote recall says the sentence that actually answers
  the question survived chunking. A chunker that splits mid-thought scores well
  on the first and badly on the second, which is precisely the failure a
  session-level metric hides.
* **latest-state recall** — on knowledge-update questions, whether the *most
  recent* evidence session was retrieved. Retrieving only the superseded state
  is worse than retrieving nothing: it produces a confident, stale answer.
