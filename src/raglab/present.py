"""Read-only presentation helpers shared by the RAG Lab service (:9002) and its
read-only Inspector (:9003).

These used to live in `inspector.py` alone. The lab now records what a job
actually ran and needs to describe it the same two ways the Inspector already
does — chunks grouped by session after indexing, and which retrieval
candidates are gold — so `server.py` needs them too. `inspector.py` already
imports `Jobs` from `server.py`; `server.py` importing back from `inspector.py`
would be a circular import, so both import from this module instead.

    contains it **as well as** when it contains the quote — a chunk smaller than
    its quote is real evidence and must still be marked — but that candidate
    holds no verbatim quote to highlight. Guessing a range for it would draw a
    green stripe over text the ground truth never quoted, so those return
    nothing and the row is gold with no highlight, which is the truth.

    Overlapping and touching ranges are merged: two `<mark>` elements over the
    same characters nest, and nested marks render as a darker stripe that reads
    as a third kind of evidence. Verbatim `str.find` rather than the normaliser
