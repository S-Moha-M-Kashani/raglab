"""Which language model runs which stage.

Seven stages of the lab can call a model, and they want different things from
one. The summariser runs once per session (157 calls per build) and wants cheap;
the key-facts judge runs once per question and wants the strongest thing
available; the reranker sits in the latency path of every query. Sharing one
model across all of them makes those trade-offs unmeasurable, so each stage
carries its own choice and nothing here is hard-coded.

Two rules the catalogue keeps:

**Every option says where its weights stand.** On a Farsi corpus the open-weight
models are the interesting ones — they can be run locally later, which is the
whole direction of the brain's LLMProvider seam — so `open` / `closed` is part of
the label, not a footnote.

**The remote catalogue offers only models this account can reach.** The old rule
— an unrun model stays listed as NA, "worth trying, nobody measured it yet" —
was checked against the wire on 2026-08-02 and had rotted: all six open-weight
options answered 404 ("no endpoints matching your guardrail restrictions and
data policy"), so NA had stopped meaning "unmeasured" and started meaning
"broken", the one thing a dropdown must not hide. The local list keeps the old
rule, because there NA is honest: a tag that is merely not pulled is one
`ollama pull` away, and the daemon is asked directly rather than guessed at.
Availability is still verified against OpenRouter's own model list when a key is
present, and never guessed when it is not.
