"""Every factor in the lab, explained.

Twenty-eight knobs and seven model roles is more than anybody holds in their
head, and a knob you cannot explain is a knob you cannot make a real decision
about. So each one carries a sentence or three, served over the API and shown
next to the control behind a `!`.

The text lives beside the definition it describes — knobs in `config.HELP`,
model roles in `models.ROLES` — and this module only assembles the two and
reports what is missing. `missing()` returning anything is a test failure, which
is what stops a new field from shipping unexplained.
