"""RAGAS bridge.

Two tiers, because they cost different things and answer different questions:

**offline** — `NonLLMContextPrecisionWithReference` and `NonLLMContextRecall`
score the retrieved context against the ground truth's verbatim evidence quotes
using string similarity. No model, no key, no variance. These are the RAGAS
numbers to compare configurations on.

**llm** — `Faithfulness` (is the answer supported by the context?),
`ResponseRelevancy`, `FactualCorrectness` and the LLM context metrics. These
judge generation, which no deterministic metric can, and they need a model.
OpenRouter serves the chat model; it serves no embeddings, so the lab's own
embedder is wrapped for the one metric that needs vectors instead of silently
falling back to an OpenAI embedding call the user never asked to pay for.

RAGAS is an optional dependency of the lab, not of the brain. Everything here is
imported lazily and every failure is reported as a note rather than raised — a
missing wheel must not take the panel down.

#
# What is deliberately excluded and why: `factual_correctness` scores against
# the reference *answer*, so it grades the fixture's phrasing as much as the
# pipeline; the offline pair are whole-string similarity, so they penalise large
# chunks regardless of whether the answer is inside them (measured: switching to
# multi-turn semantic segments halved them while *raising* quote recall), which
# makes them unusable for ranking across chunkers; and our own deterministic
# metrics grade retrieval almost exclusively, so ranking on them picks a config
# that finds the evidence and then says nothing useful about it. Those stay as
# the numbers to *debug* with — they never vary between runs, which is exactly
# what a judged score cannot promise.
