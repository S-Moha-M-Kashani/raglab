"""Embedders for the lab, behind the production `Embedder` protocol.

`ascii-hash` is the embedder the brain ships with today. It is here as a
*baseline*, and it is expected to score near zero on this corpus: its tokeniser
is `[a-z0-9]+`, so a Farsi sentence contains no tokens at all and every vector
is the zero vector. That is the whole point of measuring it — the lab should
show, in numbers, that shipping diary memory on the current default would
retrieve nothing.

`token-hash` and `char-hash` are offline, dependency-free, and Unicode-aware, so
CI can measure real retrieval without downloading a model. `fastembed` is the
honest ceiling: a multilingual transformer (Persian is in its training mix,
unlike bge-small-en, which the brain hardwires today).

**Which languages an option covers is the first fact about it**, so every entry
below carries that as text the panel shows next to the dropdown. On a Farsi diary
this is not a footnote: most of the famous embedders — bge-small-en,
all-MiniLM-L6 — are English-only models that would produce a full set of
plausible-looking numbers measuring nothing at all. **The catalogue offers only
models that have embedded a sentence on this machine** (checked 2026-08-02):
"worth trying, nobody measured it" had rotted into half-fetched downloads and
models no backend here serves, so NA now means one thing — *this installation*
cannot load it — and availability is *verified* against what fastembed actually
serves instead of guessed.

**Queries and passages are embedded separately** because the E5 family was
trained that way ("query: " / "passage: "). Omitting the prefixes is a silent
accuracy loss, which is exactly the kind of loss this lab exists to prevent, so
the prefixes belong to the model entry and retrieval goes through
`query_vectors()` rather than calling `embed()` on a question.
