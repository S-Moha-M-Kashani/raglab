// tests/sorttable.test.js — the column sorter both RAG lab panels share.
//
// Contract under test: `src/raglab/static/sorttable.js`, loaded as a plain
// script by the lab (:9002) and the Inspector (:9003) — the two pages are served
// out of the same directory, which is what lets one file be the single answer to
// "what does clicking a header do". Its DOM half is verified in a real
// browser; what is tested here is the part that decides an *order*, because that
// is where a sorter is wrong in ways nobody notices:
//
//   cellKey(text)          -> { missing, number, text }
//   compare(a, b, dir)     -> negative / zero / positive, missing always last
//
// Evaluated in a `vm` context rather than imported, so the browser file needs no
// module wrapper it would otherwise carry only for this test.
