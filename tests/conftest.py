    repeated per test: eleven chances to remember, one miss, and by 2026-08-02
    two thirds of the 154 files in `.runs/` were suite leakage rather than runs
    anybody asked for. The leaderboard's own quarantine rules (no judge, no
    recorded sample) kept them from corrupting a comparison, which is why it
    went unnoticed for so long — the cost was a durable artefact directory that
    was mostly noise.

    Session-scoped so the per-test `monkeypatch.setattr(evaluate, 'RUNS_DIR',
    tmp_path)` calls still win where a test wants its own empty directory, and
    so reads and writes within one test agree. `config.RUNS_DIR` is left
