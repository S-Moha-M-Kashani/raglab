"""Build the leaderboard from `.runs/`, and refuse to rank rows that are not
comparable.

    uv run raglab-leaderboard              # print it
    uv run raglab-leaderboard --write docs/rag-leaderboard.md

The point of this module is the refusal. A decision score is a mean over
questions, judged by a model — so it is comparable only against rows that scored
**the same questions with the same judge**. One flat ranking over everything on
disk is precisely where that gets forgotten, and this lab has already produced
both kinds of incomparable pair: the sample moved from 24 strided questions to 30
balanced ones, and the judge moved from `openai/gpt-5-mini` to a model on this
machine. Either change alone makes a row a different measurement; presented in one
sorted list they read as a ranking.

So: **group first, rank second.** A group is one (question set, judge) pair. Rows
are ranked inside a group and never across groups, and each group states in its
own heading which sample and which judge it is.

The second refusal is about margins. `verdict()` calls a group a tie when the lead
is inside the error, because 0.6487 against 0.6501 was a real pair here — opposite
changes to one knob, precision and recall merely trading places — and a bare
ranking read it as a win. A group whose rows carry no measured error returns
'unknown' rather than a winner: the runs predating `decision_spread` cannot have
one reconstructed, and `± 0` would present the oldest rows as the most precise.

Nothing here recomputes a score. It reads what the runs stored, so a number on the
leaderboard can always be checked against the run file that produced it — which is
why the run id is on every row.
