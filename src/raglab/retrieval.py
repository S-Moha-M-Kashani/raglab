"""Retrieval, fusion, diversification, reranking and grading.

Every stage is separately switchable because they cover different failures, and
on this corpus the failures are specific:

* **BM25** is the only thing that reliably finds a rare literal — a company
  name, «آذر», an amount. Dense retrieval smooths those away.
* **Dense** is the only thing that finds a paraphrase — the diarist asks about
  «دعوا با همسرم» about a session that says «پریا باز شکایت کرد».
* **RRF** fuses them without needing their scores to be comparable, which they
  are not (a cosine and a BM25 score share no scale).
* **Time filtering** is what makes "پارسال پاییز" answerable at all: without a
  date pre-filter, a query about last autumn competes with fifty semantically
  identical sessions from every other month.
* **MMR** matters here more than in most corpora, because the same complaint
  recurs verbatim for a year — the top 8 by relevance can be eight
  near-duplicates of one fight.
* **Reranking** fixes the ordering the first stage got roughly right; the
  `agentic` variant adds recency and emotional importance, which is what a diary
  reader actually wants ("what's the *current* state" beats "what matches best").
* **Grading** is the only thing that produces an honest *no*: without a relevance
  gate every question gets an answer, and the ground truth's abstention set is
  scored zero by construction.
