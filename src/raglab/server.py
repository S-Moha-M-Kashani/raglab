"""The RAG Lab service: settings panel, ad-hoc query inspector, eval runner.

Binds :9002, in the 9000 block with the brains — never a board port, because the
lab's primary surface is a page *inside* the board (Assistant → "RAG test lab"),
which proxies /api/raglab/* here. It reads two JSON fixtures, holds its indexes
in memory, and writes exactly one thing: a JSON file per run in .runs/. The
standalone panel at / remains for running the lab on its own.

**It depends on no service.** There is nothing to start first and nothing that
can be down, which is why no route probes anything before creating a job.

Runs are jobs, not requests: building a fastembed index over 157 sessions and
scoring 100 questions takes longer than any sensible HTTP timeout, so creating
one answers 202 with a job id and a Location, and the panel polls that. One job at a time — concurrent runs
would fight over the same index and produce numbers neither of them describes.
