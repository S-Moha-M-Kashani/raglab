"""Lab settings and the three config objects the whole pipeline is driven by.

Splitting the knobs into IndexConfig / RetrievalConfig / GenerationConfig is not
cosmetic: only IndexConfig changes what is stored, so its fingerprint names the
in-memory index. Retrieval and generation can then be swept for free against
an index that is already built — which is what makes the settings panel usable.

**There is no *vector* storage setting here, and that is the design.** An
experiment's index lives in process memory (`store.MemoryVectors`); its results
go to one JSON file per run under RUNS_DIR and one row per finished experiment in
`ledger.py`'s SQLite, whose only setting is the `RAGLAB_DB` path it reads for
itself. The lab used to carry a Chroma url and its own database name, guarded by
a check that refused 'lodestar'; a setting that does not exist is the stronger
guard, because it cannot be pointed at real chat memory by a typo, a stale shell,
or a command copied from an old README.
