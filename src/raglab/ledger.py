"""Every experiment the lab finishes, in one SQLite file.

    databases/raglab.db               (RAGLAB_DB overrides)

Three kinds of work run in this lab — build an index, retrieve for a selected
sample, score a sample end to end — and until this module existed only the third
one left anything behind. So "what have I already tried?" was a question the lab
could not answer about two thirds of its own work, and answered about the third
only in the shape the leaderboard needed.

**One row per finished job, written before the job goes terminal.** The ordering
is load-bearing: both frontends and the Inspector poll a job until it stops
running, so a row written *after* `state = 'done'` is a row a follower can look
for and miss.

**The row says where it ran.** `provider` is the resolved backend, not the
payload's request, because `fake` answers and judges without ever failing: a run
on the stub produces a full set of confident numbers that measured nothing, and
the only thing separating it from a real measurement is this column. `sweep.py`
refuses to start on that backend for the same reason; a ledger cannot refuse
anything, so it records instead.

**The detail is the experiment's, not the corpus's.** `detail` holds the whole
result — config, per-question rows, traced candidate ranks, notes, the sample —
which is what makes a row explicable a month later. `chunks_by_session` is
stripped: chunk text is a property of the index fingerprint, byte-identical
across every experiment sharing one, and reproduced exactly by re-running the
build. Keeping it would store the corpus once per experiment.

**Nothing backs this up.** In Lodestar the ledger lived in `databases/test/`,
the disposable half, so the backup script that walked `databases/real/` needed no
exception for it — a rule that could not be forgotten rather than one that had to
be remembered. This repository has no backup script at all, so the rule is now
simply the fact: experiments are reproducible from the fixtures and specific to
one machine, and this file is the only thing that would be missed. `*.db` keeps
it out of git.

**This is not the lab's vector store and must never become one.** The index
still lives in process memory and is discarded with the process, for the reasons
in `store.py`: a sweep rebuilds it dozens of times and the cheapest way for a
stale collection to be found is to still be there. What is durable here is the
record of what ran — never the vectors it ran over.

"""Alternatives considered
=======================

Why did you write your own persistence layer instead of using an ORM — or just
keeping the JSON files?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because this is one table with seventeen scalar columns and one JSON blob,
written once per experiment and read by two `SELECT`s. Raw `sqlite3` is 40 lines
of it; every library that would help costs a dependency and a mapping layer to
do the same two statements. The lab is test-only tooling and its whole value is
that a reader can hold it in their head.

**Why the obvious option fails.** The obvious option was to keep doing nothing —
`.runs/*.json` plus a directory listing, which is how the leaderboard already
works. It fails on the question this module exists to answer. `list_runs` globs
a directory and parses every file to build a listing: at 166 files that is 22 MB
of JSON read to render twenty rows, and it can only ever list *evaluations*,
because an index build and a retrieval have no run file. Extending the JSON
scheme to those means inventing a second directory and a second listing parser,
and "which experiments ran on the fake provider?" would still be a full scan of
both. `SELECT ... WHERE provider = 'fake'` is why a database is the right shape
here even though the vector store deliberately is not.

**Why not the framework.** FastAPI and LangChain are already dependencies and
neither offers anything: FastAPI has no storage layer, and LangChain's stores
(`SQLRecordManager`, the chat-message histories) are keyed for indexing and
conversation replay, not for rows the panel ranks. SQLAlchemy is not a
dependency of this project at all, and adding one to the *lab* — which pins
`langchain-openai<1` for ragas and already carries four version pins — buys a
migration story for a table that will not migrate.

**The libraries that would do it.**

- **SQLAlchemy Core** (no ORM) — typed columns, real migrations via Alembic,
  and dialect portability this will never use. The pick on a greenfield service.
- **SQLModel** — Pydantic models as tables, which pairs neatly with FastAPI; it
  would make `row_for` a model constructor. Ties the schema to a Pydantic major
  version, and the lab is already fighting version pins.
- **Dataset** — the smallest of them; `db['experiments'].insert(row)` and
  schema-on-write. Genuinely less code than this file, at the cost of a schema
  nothing states and a table whose columns depend on which row was inserted
  first.
- **Pandas + Parquet** — no schema DDL, and the leaderboard's grouping would be
  a `groupby`. Wrong for the write pattern: one row appended per experiment,
  hours apart, from a background thread.

**Why they were not adopted, and what would change it.** Decisively: the board
server next door is 3,000 lines of backend with **zero npm dependencies** and
`node:sqlite` doing exactly this. A lab that reached for an ORM to write one
table would be the odd one out in its own repo. Behind that, `sqlite3` is
stdlib, so this file adds nothing to `uv.lock` and cannot break the offline
brain suite.

What would change the decision: a second table with a foreign key to this one —
per-question rows promoted out of the `detail` blob so a query could ask "which
questions does every candidate fail?" That is a join, an index, and a migration
of existing rows, and hand-rolled SQL stops being cheaper than SQLAlchemy Core
at roughly the second migration. The measurement that would force it is the blob
itself: if `detail` grows past a few MB per row, storing traces as JSON becomes
the thing to fix, and the fix is a table.
