"""Write a finished run out as one readable page per question — what the
pipeline retrieved, said, and was graded on, argued in a way the leaderboard's
single number cannot.

**This module only reports what the run stored.** Retrieved sessions are the
ids the run recorded, never re-run to reconstruct chunk text, which would
document a different retrieval against a possibly rebuilt index. The four
deciding RAGAS metrics are stored as run means, not per sample, and are labelled
as such on every page — an unlabelled 0.77 beside one question would read as
that question's faithfulness.

"Answered correctly" is evidence-based, not judged, since no judged per-question
grade is stored: an answerable question counts when the pipeline did not refuse
and reached a gold session; an unanswerable one counts when it refused.
